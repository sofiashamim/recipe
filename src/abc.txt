Useeffect hook is used to run side effect such as :
fetching api, 
updating the dom,
it takes 2 parameters- first is a callback function and- second is aarray of dependency.

If array of dependency is blank useeefect will run only one time.
If we write a variable inside the array of dependency then the useeffect will render to update the function till that variable.

We can convert a API into dynamic data by using backticks or curly-braces.Another way of converting into dynamic data is by using $ sign before curly-braces and in that curly braces write the keyword which you want to use to change the search options.
Dynamic data=?
